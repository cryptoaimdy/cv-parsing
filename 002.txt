Achievements and Interests:
I enjoy participating in sports, in particular netball, where I play at a regional level. Through playing netball, I can work well as part of a team working towards a specific goal. 

 In 2007 I was rewarded at school by being made a prefect and in 2008 I was further rewarded by being made a senior prefect. During my time at Branksome School, I also assisted with paired reading where I helped fellow pupils improve their confidence.

I am highly capable when using computers and organising data after working for EMA. Despite only working there for a short period of time I hit all targets with minimal mistakes. I can use Microsoft office programmes with ease and I consider myself a fast and focused learner.
Through retail, I have gained experience in dealing with the public on a one to one basis, handling money and using tills. I find this experience invaluable as I can deal with different situations confidently and I can work well within a team as well as individually.
