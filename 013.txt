I am 31 years old with a keen interest in music,  art,  computing,  cooking,
DIY, science, law, survival  and  bush  craft,  consciousness  and  esoteric
studies,  world  culture  and  alternative   history,   writing,   freelance
journalism, photography and radio hosting.  I am a quick  and  conscientious
learner and like to explore new possibilities and  experiences.   Throughout
my life I have continually evolved and learnt a more  holistic  approach  to
situations and look upon each new challenge  as  part  of  my  own  personal
development as well as contributing to mutually  beneficial  solutions.    I
am an  equally  enthusiastic  and  responsible  worker  in  group  and  solo
situations and I humbly admit that I see no task being  beyond  my  ability,
from  physical  labour,  technological  and  administrative  capacities,  to
official and managerial requirements.  I am friendly, sociable,  upbeat  and
outgoing, and looking forward to my next career opportunity.
