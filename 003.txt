Summary:  I am hard working reliable and honest. I have excellent communication skills, and I am very friendly, I have no problem working on my own and as part of a team. I enjoy looking after a team of staff, and enjoy the day to day life of working in retail. I enjoy speaking to customers and feel I am very approachable. I am open to new skills and always looking for ways to build on my knowledge.

My jobs recently have been working in pubs, as a waitress/ bar staff. Last year I finished working at Orange, through Adecco, in the Collections department; my duties were working on an outbound and inbound system where I spoke to customers regarding an outstanding balance that they had on their contracts. My main goal was to collect the amount owing where possible, or set up arrangements for payment. I was top collector several times, and worked really hard to working to the best of my ability. I have good knowledge of computers and am confident on the telephone and have an excellent telephone and customer services manners. I am honest , reliable, and very hard working and trust that I would be an asset to any team that I was a part of, but however I am very good and capable of working on my own too. I have a lot of experience in bar and retail too.

Education: Hummersknott Comprehensive School and Language College, I received GCSE’S in English, Maths, Science, Health and Social Care, I.C.T, Drama, and Media Studies.
