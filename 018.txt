Employment history
Place of work:   Lido Garage, Coast road, Blackhall Rocks, Hartlepool, TS27
                            4BJ
I have recently been employed after doing a two year apprentice with
Hartlepool College of further education at Lido Garage. I am now working
towards my NVQ level 3 to become a MOT tester and should be fully qualified
by May 2011.

Skills and interests
I have plenty experience working on cars and motorbikes as I occasionally
fix my own motorcycle or family member’s cars. I am good at working as part
of a team and insuring that a job is completed to the highest standard. I
am able to work on my own and understand the importance of completing jobs
within the scheduled time.
